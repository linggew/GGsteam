      <h2>Project Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of this project is to create a gaming community website,
        catering to Steam users, where they can explore new games, discover
        gaming deals, and connect with gamers with the same interests. Users
        will be able to explore the latest games, receive the recommended games,
        find top games by different categories, the ability to mark their
        favorite games, track game prices, and provide game reviews. This
        platform will serve as a hub for gamers to share their experiences,
        discuss their interests, and build connections with their friends. With
        a user-friendly interface and a comprehensive set of features, our
        website aims to enhance the experience for Steam users to find and share
        games.{' '}

      <h2>Contribution</h2>
      <p>
        Our project is organized into four distinct sections: Data Processing,
        Database Design, Frontend UI Implementation, and Backend Implementation.
        Initially, our team was divided into two groups, with two members
        focusing on UI implementation and two on data processing and database
        design. We diligently processed and prepared the data, designed an
        efficient database schema, and created a user-friendly front-end
        interface. As the project evolved, we seamlessly transitioned to backend
        development, where we integrated the processed data to provide valuable
        functionalities. The following highlights our distribution.
