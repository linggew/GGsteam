# Project Title: GGSteam

## Project Summary
The goal of this project is to create a gaming community website, catering to Steam users, where they can explore new games, discover gaming deals, and connect with gamers with the same interests. Users will be able to explore the latest games, receive the recommended games, find top games by different categories, the ability to mark their favorite games, track game prices, and provide game reviews. This platform will serve as a hub for gamers to share their experiences, discuss their interests, and build connections with their friends. With a user-friendly interface and a comprehensive set of features, our website aims to enhance the experience for Steam users to find and share games.
