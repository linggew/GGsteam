## Description
The Game entity contains information from the Steam Games dataset. The entity has a unique Query_id and all the required information about the game like Name, release_date, Is_free, Platform, Price Initial,Price Final, AboutText, game type and category_id. This information can help us display the games to search results and filter the game during recommendations. There are 5 relationships related to Game Entity:
The relationship between the Game entity and Review entity is Many to One, as a Game can have many reviews but a review can only be for one game.
The relationship between Game and Category is Many to Many as we assume that one game can have many categories and one category can have many games.
The relationship between Game and PC is One to One that a game needs one recommended PC, and a recommended PC corresponds to one Game.
There are two relationships between User and Game and both are Many to Many. The first relationship is a user can own many games and one game can be owned by many users. The second relationship is a user can wishlist many games and one game can be added to wishlist by many users.

The Category entity contains information about all the categories the game belongs to. The only relationship for Category is between Game and Category. The relationship between Game and Category is Many to Many as we assume that one game can have many categories and one category can have many games.

The User entity contains information about users for our website such as a unique Userid, Username, Password, pc_id, and preference_id. There are several relationships for User Entity:
The relationship between User and PC is One to One as we assume that a user will have at most one computer and computer information can only belong to one user. 
The relationship between Preference and User is One to One as we assume that a user will have only one preference setting and one preference setting can only belong to one user.
The relationship between User and Review is One to Many as we assume that a user can post many reviews and one review only belongs to one user.
There are two relationships between User and Game and both are Many to Many. The first relationship is a user can own many games and one game can be owned by many users. The second relationship is a user can wishlist many games and one game can be added to a wishlist by many users.

The Preference entity contains information about the usersâ€™ settings for the web page and they can modify the preferences any time while using the website. The preference includes dark_mode, showTop_10, and showrecent_released game. There is only one relationship for Preference Entity. The relationship between Preference and User is One to One as we assume that a user will have only one preference setting and one preference setting can only belong to one user.

The PC entity contains information about users' computer information entered by the user the first time they start to use our website. The information includes Pc_id, CPU, GPU, ROM, Storage, RAM. This entity will help us ensure compatibility for the games searched and recommended to them. The relationship between User and PC is One to One as we assume that a user will have at most one computer and computer information can only belong to one user. The relationship between Game and PC is One to One that a game needs one recommended PC, and a recommended PC corresponds to one Game.

The Review entity contains information from the Steam Games dataset. The entity includes unique reviewid, userid, query_id, and review_content. There are two relationships for Review Entity. First, The relationship between the Game entity and Review entity is Many to One, as a Game can have many reviews but a review can only be for one game. The other, The relationship between User and Review is One to Many as we assume that a user can post many reviews and one review only belongs to one user.

## Normalization

For the sake of simplicity, all attributes that are only related to one key are summarized as `xxx_attr`

### Apply 3NF

$pc\\_id \to pc\\_attr$; \
$user\\_id \to user\\_attr, \underline{pc\\_id}, \underline{preference\\_id}$; \
$preference\\_id \to preference\\_attr$; \
$review\\_id \to review\\_attr$; \
$query\\_id \to game\\_attr, \underline{pc\\_id}$; \
$category\\_id \to category\\_attr$; \
$user\\_id, query\\_id \to \underline{review\\_id}$

The relationship is already in 3NF form, because all the LHS is the superkey of RHS, or the RHS is part of a key (underlined).

The reason for using 3NF is that it has dependency preservation, unlike BNCF which does not. 3NF can also avoid information loss.
